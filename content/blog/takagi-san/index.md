## What kind of anime is it?

The anime is a romantic comedy of middle high school students. A takagi-san always tease her classmate, Nishioka who she likes. It is nice and warm anime.

## How good it was?

I would give 4.5 out of 5.

## My point of view

I watched a lot of Japanese anime. The most of main charactors in anime is too insensitive or passive about sexuality or relationships even though they are mature enough. Sometimes, I feel like "What? Why he or she did not do anything? Is he or she really high school student? No way!!" But, this anime is a bit different from the other anime. The one of the main charactor Nishioka is also super insensitive and passive. However, he is just around 12 years old!! He is literally kid. That makes sense even if he is not mature at all. Also, I think the most of charactors are not perfect like other Japanese anime, except Takagi-san. Takagi-san is cute, good at sports, smart, good at arts and so forth. She is too much perfect girl. I've never seen that kind of girl in Japan. But, I feel that I've seen other charactors somewhere else in Japan.

## Shoud you watch this anime?

If you like action or battle things, no. This anime is too heartwarming for you. But if you like nice, romantic and heartwarming video or movies, yes. You should watch it. Also, if you are interested in the way of Japanese life, this anime ise good for you. You will catch a glimpse of the way of Japanese life.
